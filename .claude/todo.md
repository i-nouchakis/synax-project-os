### Implementation Notes

**Key Technologies:**
- Konva.js (canvas rendering) - already integrated
- React Konva - React wrapper
- Zustand - state management for drawing tools
- Prisma - database models
- jsPDF - PDF export
- rbush (future) - spatial indexing for performance

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Cable connections support Asset→Asset, Room→Room, Floor→Floor, and mixed
- Cable bundling reduces visual clutter for parallel cables
- Layers enable complex drawings with selective visibility
- JSON data field in models allows flexible shape properties without schema changes
- Routing algorithms user-selectable, not auto-decided

**User Preferences:**
- User decides routing mode (no auto-assumptions)
- Both floor and room level support
- Export with layer/cable removal options
- Full layer management (add, delete, rename, reorder, lock, hide, opacity)
- Correctness prioritized over implementation speed

**Testing Checklist (Before "Done"):**
- [ ] TypeScript strict check (frontend + backend)
- [ ] Draw each shape type
- [ ] Create cable with all 4 routing modes
- [ ] Test undo/redo (10+ actions)
- [ ] Multi-select (5+ shapes)
- [ ] Export to all formats (PDF, SVG, PNG, JSON)
- [ ] Layer visibility/lock/opacity
- [ ] Cable bundling (create 5+ parallel cables)
- [ ] Measurement tool with calibration
- [ ] Properties panel updates on selection

**Timeline (Realistic with Claude):**
- Intensive (2-3 hours/day): 4 weeks for V1
- Normal (1-2 hours/day): 6 weeks for V1
- Casual (few sessions/week): 8-10 weeks for V1
